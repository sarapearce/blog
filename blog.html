            <p>Post 4: Spoofing 
                I'm looking over at my husband playing pokemon go with the kids. he has a jailbroken iphone and has a tweak that allows you to geo-spoof your location, so the sucky part of playing pokemon go is now replaced with something I almost deam close to cheating the game, but not really. more of a hack really. 

                I on the otherhand have played for a total of 15 minutes the last week. Without the geo-spoofing, the game isn't fun anymore. The developers still have the "tracking" feature turned off, presumably to protect limited server capability. Without tracking, I am restricted to playing when I'm at restaurants or stores, and unfortunately my pocketbook is getting thin quickly. So I only play when we go out. Which is what I understand is the point of the game, getting out, but without the focus of tracking, I'm limited to consuming my phone with a game of randomly occurring events I have little to no control over.
